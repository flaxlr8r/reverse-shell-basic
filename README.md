# reverse Shell Basic

This project contains only two scripts,

1. Server-shell.py : which will be running on hacker's server.
2. Client-Shell.py : this will run from victim's computer and will get connected to server-shell and server shell will be able to control the client.


We multiple client support has been added. Thanks to Bucky Robert.
